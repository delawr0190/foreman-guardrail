## Guardrail ##

Guardrail is an open-source Java application that provides a mechanism to 
set constraints on [Pickaxe](https://github.com/delawr0190/foreman-apps), 
the Foreman miner monitoring and management agent.  This application is 
intended to be used in a miner hosting environment where the facility would 
like to apply local constraints, limiting the IPs that the Foreman agent can 
reach.  This puts the operator fully in control.

A typical use case for this would be:

- A colocation/hosting facility has many miners hosted, each owned by different 
  customers
- The facility would like to allow the customer access to their miners 
  through [Foreman](https://foreman.mn)
- The facility would like to apply local constraints rather than relying 
  fully on [Foreman dashboard permissions](https://foreman.mn/blog/managing-access-to-cryptocurrency-miners/)

## Requirements ##

- JDK version 8 (or higher)
- Linux (this application is currently not compatible with Windows)

## Building ##

To build the entire foreman-guardrail repository, from the top level of the 
repository:

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

Upon a successful build, you should see something similar to the following:

```sh
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

The application distributions can be found in the `target/` folders.  You'll only need one - pick the extension you prefer.

```sh
$ ls -la **/target | grep -E "\.(zip|tar)"
