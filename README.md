# foreman-guardrail

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/foremanmining/foreman-guardrail.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/foremanmining/foreman-guardrail)

## GUARDrail

GUARDrail is an open-source Java application that provides a mechanism to set
constraints on [Pickaxe](https://github.com/foremanmining/foreman-apps), the
Foreman miner monitoring and management agent. This application is intended to
be used in a miner hosting environment where the facility would like to apply
local constraints, limiting the IPs that the Foreman agent can reach. This puts
the operator fully in control.

A typical use case for this would be:

- A colocation/hosting facility has many miners hosted, each owned by different
  customers
- The facility would like to allow the customer access to their miners
  through [Foreman](https://foreman.mn)
- The facility would like to apply local constraints rather than relying fully
  on [Foreman dashboard permissions](https://foreman.mn/blog/managing-access-to-cryptocurrency-miners/)
  to guarantee that no other miners are reachable

## Requirements

- JDK version 8 (or higher)
- Linux (this application is currently not compatible with Windows)

## Usage

Since this application is currently only supported on Linux, it's automatically
installed if the `GUARDRAIL` environment variable is set to
`true`. Example:

```sh
$ curl https://tinyurl.com/service-install -Ls --output install.sh; GUARDRAIL=true sudo -E bash install.sh <client_id> <api_key>
```

Once it's running, you can access it at the following address:
`http://<computer ip>:25452`:

### Setting Constraints

#### Authentication

The Authentication parameters specify the client ID and API key that the local
Pickaxe should use when interacting with Foreman. Those can be found
[here](https://dashboard.foreman.mn/dashboard/profile/) (note: you must be
logged in). Once they're changed, it can take up to 1 minute for Pickaxe to
switch to the new credentials.

#### Restrictions

Restrictions provide a mechanism for limiting the IPs that Pickaxe can reach
regardless of the constraints in place on the Foreman dashboard. As an example,
if a user were to dispatch a `reboot` to the IP `10.10.1.5`, but that IP wasn't
in the **Allowed Ranges**, then the command would fail.

Either individual IPs or nmap-formatted ranges can be provided. Example:

```
10.0.1.2
10.0.2.6
10.1.5.5
10.2.1-2.1-3
```

Would allow:

```
10.0.1.2
10.0.2.6
10.1.5.5
10.2.1.1
10.2.1.2
10.2.1.3
10.2.2.1
10.2.2.2
10.2.2.3
```

## Building

To build the entire foreman-guardrail repository, from the top level of the
repository:

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

Upon a successful build, you should see something similar to the following:

```sh
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

The application distributions can be found in the `target/` folder. You'll only
need one - pick the extension you prefer.

```sh
$ ls -la target | grep -E "\.(zip|tar)"
